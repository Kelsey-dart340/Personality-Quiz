However, by the looks of you, no one would know you have money. If you were ever to go missing for a short amount of time, people would probably assume you are: at a strip club, are high somewhere, or you did something sketchy and are facing the consequences. Those consequences don't last long though, since you've got the money to get out of anything. You pride yourself on living like scum, since that saves you money and makes you appreciate life more. In your friend group you are the reliable money bag and are creative when it comes to eating your drinks. One request from all those around you, learn proper hygiene you bald bitch!");

Maybe from your lack of reading skills that makes it harder for others to read you. Aside from this, you are adventrous, weird, and probably a stalker. I'm sure the one you like will come around if you stop being a creep and treat them like a normal human being. However, you will probably keep up with your methods and just hope they notice how reliable you are. You have an interest in things that most don't, so people don't connect with you in that way. You are a lot of fun though, so people like to hang around just to laugh and or to do something stupid. Keep having fun in life and start trying new things!");

You are not as brave and adventurous as you pretend to be in your imagination. Instead, you are afraid of doing things that might result in slight injury, but love to tell people you could do something if some bullshit excuse was not present. It's okay to be scared of things, everybody has fears. Moving on, you are an on the go type of person and are always thinking of things to do. Your friends like this about you because you come with a plan of action and make things less boring. You are quick to anger, which is unflattering so you should try working on this. All in all, keep making up fun activities and be more honest about yourself.");

You are too focused on what others will think and say to you, that you will do anything to assert some form of dominance over them. You try not to be seen as vulnerable, but you should open up more. Life will be more tolerable and enjoyable if you can be your true self and connect with others genuinely. You really enjoy feeling better than others that you limit your own possibilities. Try new things and eat new foods, your view on value is hurting you in the long run. In your friend group you are the best looking and the leader, which is not helping with your ego. If you truly are a Dennis, you are probably very mean. This is a bad thing, you can't be better than others if no one wants to be around you. ");

It's like everyone knows to make fun of you, and you don't even stand up for yourself. I will say, some of the insults you have to blame yourself for. You are not as funny as you like to believe you are, and please stop trying to perform in front of anyone you meet. You need to be humbled, but just don't seem to understand this. Like a lot of people tell you this and you just don't listen. With more practice I'm sure you will start getting better, but randomly performing to strangers and friends will not help you. Also, with more confidence you might get better. For some reason you love to perform, but get stage fright so easy. You even get too nervous to talk to anyone you like, so a confidence boost will help you in more ways than one. So, work on your confidence and tone down the performer in you.  ");
